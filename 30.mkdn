Mewni is one step to the left from Earth, if you have the right scissors.

"Mom!" Marco yells as she barrels down the stairs. "Dad!"

"What?" Angie yells, and runs out to see her <s>son</s>daughter. "What's wrong?"
Rafael follows quickly behind, just as concerned.

Marco stops halfway down the stairs as soon as she sees them. "We're leaving
--- we've found out what Toffee is up to."

Rafael and Angie share a concerned and confused look. "Toffee was that lizard
man who almost killed you?" Rafael asks.

"We're not going to fight him, we're going to warn Star's mom," Marco says. "Don't
worry, I've learned my lesson," and with that said, Marco runs up the stairs two steps
at a time to don her armor.

----

"You go on ahead," Marco says. "I need to find Yvgeny and tell him --- he deserves to know."

Star nods. They are all decked out in their action gear --- Jackie came in her black leather,
Janna has her raven out and her coat and is weaving wards while waiting, Tom is in his best suit
with a legal pad by his side and a fountain pen in his breast pocket, and Star has the wand and
her gloves and holsters.

Marco has a stab proof vest over her dress, knee and shin protectors, steel-toed boots, gauntlets,
her trusty double-barrel shotgun, and a big gaudy sword Star had lying around.

Then they cut two portals, and take a step to the left.

----

It's not difficult to find Yvgeny --- Marco is a mildly famous face, as is the
frog man, and monsters are not so far between out here. In getting from place to place,
it helps immensely to have the ectoplasmic imprint of the monster arm, and enough strength
to jump half again her own height.

"Yvgeny!" Marco yells when she finally sees him.
She lands in the muck with a splash.

"Marco! Good to see you. How was day off? It became two, so I think good, yes?"
Yvgeny says.

Marco takes a moment to catch her breath.

Yvgeny picks up on the urgency. "Is something wrong?"

"Sitrep," Marco manages.

"Things going well, for now. Monsters in swamps like idea of peace, mostly."
Yvgeny turns to look at a nearby group.

"Can you keep things copacetic for a few more days? There's a crisis brewing."

"Of course. No guarantee, but I will do best." He holds out his big clawed hand,
and Marco shakes it. "Thanks."

"Go deal with crisis," Yvgeny says. "And--- Nice dress."

Marco blushes a little at the unexpected compliment, then
draws her scissors.

After the portal has closed, Yvgeny runs off to find Boo Fly --- you don't
get to be forty-seven in his line of work and not know when a friend is in
deep trouble; and since Marco isn't forthcoming, there's only so much Yvgeny
can do.

----

The four of them arrive in the courtyard, courtesy of Star's scissors.

"Jackie, stay here and wait for Marco," Star says.

"Yes ma'am," Jackie says.

"Tom, Janna, with me," Star says, and they run off to the courtyard doors.
The halls are bustling, and they have to slow down, passing crowds of personnel
and court members.

They reach Moon's office in short order, despite the fact that the Mewni palace is
far larger than anything on Earth, and twice as incomprehensible. Star knows the
place like the back of her hand.

Star bursts through the door without knocking, and they find Queen Butterfly
discussing some documents with a secretary from her intelligence corps. "Princess,"
she says coldly. "What's the meaning of this?"

"Sorry for the interruption," Star says. She looks at Tom, who gives her a thumbs
up. "I'm here to make amends for what I said earlier. I'd like to show you I am willing
to cooperate... Just, I have some issues I need to work through, and I would like you to
support me emotionally."

"And that justifies not knocking on my office door?" Moon asks.

"Toffee does," Star continues. "We know what he's up to."

Queen moon looks at her intelligence aide, briefly wondering how her
daughter found out something which her hundred-plus experts did not. "How so?"

"The _All Seeing Eye_ spell from Queen Eclipsa's chapter of the Book," Star
explains.

Moon pales. That spell is intense to cast, and dangerous to boot if you
don't have the raw power to back it up. Somehow she had briefly
forgotten what a powerhouse her daughter is. "Report, if you please," she says.

"We believe Toffee is seeking an alliance with my mother," Tom says. "Queen Regent of
the Underworld, EsmeÃÅe Lucitor, Succubus-in-chief."

Queen Moon nods. "Grave news. It fits with my timeline; what would Toffee have to
offer your mother?"

Tom looks at Star and Janna. "It appears Toffee can cast the All Seeing Eye spell as
well, so presumably he is supplying her with intelligence. My mother's motivation
may be to ensure my prosecution for the stunt I pulled to evade having to be king.
Um--- anything else he has to offer he, she would accept. Money, military might,
magical might---"

"Good, it is as I thought," Queen Moon says. "You may not have heard, but some time
yesterday night, one of my cousin's servants staggered into the palace city.
She's been abducted, and Toffee intends to ransom her back to us."

Star has never heard of her mother having a cousin. "Who?"

"She changed her name to 'Heinous' a few years ago, and devoted herself to
her position as headmistress of Saint Olga's," Moon says. "We've had our differences,
but I have to get her back."

Star's eyebrows are close to crawling off her forehead, and her eyes could hardly be wider.
"Heinous is _family?_"

"Yes. And I intend to pay Toffee's quite reasonable ransom. Whatever his motives may be,
I know my old arch enemy stands by his word."

----

Marco steps through into the palace courtyard.

"This way," Jackie says, and they start running --- until they reach the main doors and
the two guardsmen cross their halberds.

The side-doors slam open, and a tide of armed guards pour into the courtyard. In the battlements
above, dozens of crossbows are pointed at them.

Jackie reaches for her scissors, but Marco stops her. "We surrender!
What's this about?" Marco calls out.

The group of soldiers part to reveal Madam Hauette. "Sir Marco Diaz, you are under
arrest for Revolutionary Conspiracy. Dame Thomas, excellent work bringing this elusive
fugitive to justice."

"I--- I _didn't_," Jackie says.

Marco puts a hand on Jackie's shoulder. "Don't worry about it, go tell Star," she says.
Then she turns and holds up both hands. "I surrender!" she repeats.

Jackie Steps away.

----

It's amazing how far one can see from a few hundred feet in the sky with a good pair of binoculars.

Boo Fly lowers his pair --- it's difficult to see through them with faceted eyes, but he
manages as a matter of personal pride in his espionage ability.

"Shoot; Frogman was right," he mutters to himself.

----

Jackie Appears just past the two guard stationed outside Queen Moon's office, much to the 
chagrin of the guardsmen, and surprise of Star, Tom, Janna, and the Queen.

"Marco--- It's," she says. "Madam Hauette had her arrested in the courtyard."

There's a moment of stunned silence.

"I---" Star says, "I don't understand..." she looks to her mother. "What?"

"On what charges?" Tom asks. Monarchies have laws too, and Tom once hoped he could flatter
Star with his knowledge of Mewni's.

"Revolutionary Conspiracy," Jackie says.

Queen Moon looks at the intelligence officer. "Find me your boss, and tell her to see
me immediately."

"How bad is revolutionary conspiracy?" Janna asks.

"Punishable by imprisonment or death by hanging," Queen Moon says.

Tom is the only one to whom this isn't news. 

"But--- Can't you just pardon Marco?" Star asks.

Moon takes a deep breath. "You, there," she calls to the door. "Guardsman, Tim, was it?"

One of the two guards turns and comes in, stands straight, and salutes.

"Get me coffee and bark of willow," she says. "And yes, I know you're not a butler," she
adds, anticipating his objection. "You're allowed to delegate."

"Yes, M'lady," he says, and leaves quickly.

Queen Moon flicks her hand and the doors close. "No, I cannot _just_ pardon Marco,
Star," she holds up a hand to stifle objections, "under no circumstances will I allow
your appointed knight to come to harm, don't worry. But this has just become a _delicate_
situation."

"The Counter-revolutionary Act created grounds for the alliance that gives Mewni its
stable political scene," Tom says. "To discourage noble houses from funding
rebels in each others fiefdoms, which was what created the crisis you inherited
after Queen Comet."

Queen Moon looks at Tom with an approving smile. "You're quite well read, Master Lucitor."

"Thank you, m'lady."

"Tom is right," Moon continues. "If I pardon Marco, it will look like I am funding him
--- never mind what's the fact of the matter; my political enemies will accuse me of
hypocrisy, and bring the strength of the alliance into question."

"But the swamp---" Star says.

"---Is technically the fiefdom of the Avarius house," Tom finishes.
